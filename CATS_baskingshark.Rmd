Here I'm going to bring in the initial raw dataset from CATSCam, shark 2
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
setwd("~/Desktop/Basking sharks/bs.git")
data <- read.csv("Shark 2_CATS.csv")
head(data)
table(data$Date) #so, all have the same date (July 26, 2013)
data$Time[1] #first time: 19:16:45
data$Time[nrow(data)] #end time: 22:10:47
```
So, now we need to think about what we are interested in. We want to know time, feeding, pressure, temperature, light intensity, ODBA

```{r}
dat2 <- data[,c(2,4, 5, 12, 19, 20, 21, 22)]
head(dat2)
colnames(dat2) <- c("Time", "Feeding", "Pressure", "Temp1", "Temp2", "Light", "Temp.ext", "ODBA") #still don't know what some of these things are - need to ask Heather
```
